This was my first ever attempt at building an app whilst learning HTML, CSS and Javascript before the commencement of the bootcamp.
I wanted to create a portfolio that was eye-catching, elegant and dinamic. 

Coming from a graphic design background, I wanted to ensure that the user had a good experience whilst navigating through the website.

It's a good reminder of how much I have learned in 4 months!
