                <h1> Hi there, thank you for stopping by.</h1>
                <p> My name is Roki, and I am a recent graduate from King's College London. I am an avid reader with a background in fine arts, music and medical anthropology. I believe in learning through traveling, and I collect flowers wherever I go. I
                    spend too much time daydreaming, but I am an ambitious individual with big dreams.
                </p>
                <p> Although my interests are numerous, I have become fascinated with coding, which I hope to continue learning through the _nology course. My style is quite minimalist in terms of writing, as I prefer to let images, animations and codes do
                    the talking. Hopefully, by the end of the course, I'll be able to present you projects that reflect my persona.
                </p>
                <p> see you soon! </p>
