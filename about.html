                <h1> Hi there, thank you for stopping by.</h1>
                <p> My name is Roki, and I am a recent graduate from King's College London. If you came across my "passions" page, you should already have a pretty good idea of who I am and what I do in my everyday life. I should also add that I daydream
                    excessively (but such dreams are what keep me going) and I grew up playing percussions in an orchestra, so music is always playing in my ears and my head. I am a self-claimed overachiever who just love to learn. </p>
                <p> Although my interests are numerous, somehow I never thought that coding would be my thing. I'm glad I was wrong. Software development, data science, ui/ux design are filling up my days now, and I am finding myself extremely attracted to
                    this digital world. By the end of the _nology course, I hope to be able to let images, animations and codes show my creativity and skills.

                </p>
                <p> until then, see you soon! :) </p>
