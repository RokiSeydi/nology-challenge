                <h1> Hi there, thank you for stopping by.</h1>
                <p> My name is Roki, and I am a London-based recent graduate. If you came across my "passions" page, you might already have a pretty good idea of who I am and what I do in my everyday life. I should also add that I daydream excessively (but
                    such dreams are goals that I chase) and I grew up playing percussions in an orchestra, so music is always playing in my ears and my head. I am a self-claimed overachiever who just love to learn (aka, a nerd). </p>
                <p> Although my interests are numerous, somehow I never thought that coding would be my thing. I'm glad I was wrong. Software development, data science, ui/ux design are tormenting me nowawadys, but I can't help but being extremely fascinated
                    by this digital world. By the end of the _nology course, I hope to be able to let images, animations and codes show my creativity and skills.

                </p>
                <p> until then, see you soon! :) </p>
